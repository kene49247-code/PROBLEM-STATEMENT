        <h3>1.People are earning more but don’t know how to manage money</h3>
        <p>In today’s fast-changing economy, income opportunities have increased through jobs, freelancing, start-ups, and online platforms. However, many people still lack basic knowledge about how to manage that income wisely. They do not learn budgeting, saving, investing, spending control or financial planning at school. As a result, even people who earn good salaries often face financial stress, debt problems and zero savings at the end of the month. Without proper financial education, higher income does not always lead to a better financial life.
        </p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>2.  Digital payments, online trading, UPI, and crypto are growing</h3>
        <p>       ndia is becoming one of the world’s fastest-growing digital economies. From UPI to mobile banking, digital payments are now part of daily life. Young people are entering online trading, crypto investing, and digital financial platforms at a very early age. While digital finance brings convenience and new opportunities, it also requires safe practices. Many users invest without proper research, which increases the risk of losing money. Therefore, learning financial literacy has become essential in a digital world.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>3.Financial scams are increasing</h3>
        <p> With the shift towards online and digital transactions, financial scams are growing rapidly. Cyber fraud, investment scams, fake apps, phishing messages, and misleading schemes are targeting people every day. Scammers mostly take advantage of those who are not financially aware. Lack of knowledge about safe banking practices, online security, and investment risks makes individuals more vulnerable. Awareness and financial education can help people identify and avoid such frauds and protect their hard-earned money.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>4.  Loans, EMI culture, credit cards are common</h3>
        <p>n recent years, personal loans, short-term loans, and credit cards have become extremely easy to access. EMI culture encourages people to buy smartphones, vehicles, appliances, and even lifestyle products on credit. While this gives financial flexibility, many individuals do not understand interest rates, repayment rules, late fees, or the impact on credit score. This leads to long-term debt and financial burden. Proper financial awareness helps people borrow responsibly instead of becoming dependent on credit.</p>
